Variables
=========
From the features_info.txt file in the original data set (see **Original Data** section below):

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

Original Data
=============
Data for the project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The complete data set was downloaded on August 19, 2014 from:

Transformations
===============
The script in run_analysis.R transforms the original data set into a smaller tidy data

The original data set is read from:

* 'features.txt': List of all features.  
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.  
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.  
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.  
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.  
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.  
* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  
* 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.  

The following transformations are performed on the loaded data tables:

1. Combine subject_test and subject_train data tables together by row.

2. Combine X_train and X_test data tables together by row.

3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in the combined X data table.

4. Combine the y_test and y_train class labels data tables by row.

5. Merge the class labels with their activity names.

6. Combine the class labels, subject ids and X data sets into one data table by column.

7. Save the data table to a CSV file (tidy_data.txt).

8. Find the mean of all data values grouped by activity and subject.

9. Save the aggredate data table to a CSV file (tidy_means.txt).
