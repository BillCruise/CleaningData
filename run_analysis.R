# Performs the following functions:
#   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
#   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#   5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#
# The dataDir parameter is the directory where the data files are stored.
# The default dataDir is "." Use the default if the original data files are extracted
# to your current working directory.
# Otherwise, pass in a path (e.g., "./UCI HAR Dataset") to the extracted files.
